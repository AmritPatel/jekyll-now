title: NCAAB Performance Trends
---

Extending the previous two posts further, I've created another Shiny app to quickly get a handle on recent NCAAB Division I performance trends. Check it out [here](https://amritpatel.shinyapps.io/Recent-Performance/).

You can select the number of top teams for examining BPI trends over time, change the number of best/worst teams to view, and change the number of hot/cold teams to view.
